## Overview

**AskMyArticle** is an interactive, AI-powered web application designed to transform how users engage with online written content. Built with **Streamlit**, this tool empowers users to input up to three publicly available article URLs and receive insightful, context-aware answers to their questions ‚Äî in real time.

Using a powerful combination of OpenAI's language models, **FAISS vector indexing**, and LangChain's Retrieval QA pipeline, AskMyArticle processes and semantically indexes article content into meaningful vector representations. This enables users to perform deep semantic searches and ask natural-language questions with reliable and accurate source references.

Whether you‚Äôre a student conducting research, a journalist analyzing multiple sources, or a developer prototyping intelligent reading tools, AskMyArticle offers a seamless way to read less and understand more.

## Features

- **Multi-URL Ingestion:** Add and process up to **three article URLs** at once ‚Äî ideal for comparing sources or exploring multiple perspectives.
- **Semantic Vector Search:** Utilizes **OpenAI Embeddings** to convert article content into high-dimensional vector representations, stored efficiently using **FAISS**.
- **Context-Aware Q&A:** Employs **LangChain‚Äôs RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain**, which retrieves the most relevant chunks of information and generates grounded answers ‚Äî along with source references.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with **Streamlit**, offering a clean and interactive frontend where users can add URLs, ask questions, and view AI responses with ease.
- **Persistent Indexing:** All embeddings and vector stores are saved locally in the `INDEX/` directory, allowing for re-use without reprocessing articles every session.
- **Secure Key Handling:** API keys are managed using a `.env` file and loaded securely using the `dotenv` package to keep your credentials safe.

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AskMyArticle.git
cd AskMyArticle
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add Your OpenAI API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 4. Launch the App

```bash
streamlit run tool.py
```
